Adi is a research fellow with [Marine Energy Research Australia](https://marineenergyresearch.com.au/) (MERA), [The University of Western Australia](https://www.uwa.edu.au/home) (UWA). His research covers aspects of wave energy conversion, wave-structure interactions, and multi-objective optimisation. He has numerically modelled a variety of wave energy converters (WECs) and is deeply interested in how geometry and motion influence wave absorption and loads.

Adi obtained his PhD in Marine Technology from the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)](https://www.ntnu.edu/). During his PhD, he participated in the [_NumWEC project: Numerical estimation of energy delivery from a selection of wave energy converters_](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2011.10.002), a collaboration between NTNU and [Centrale Nantes](https://www.ec-nantes.fr) comparing the performance of several different WECs through numerical modelling.

Before joining UWA, Adi was with [Aalborg University](https://www.en.aau.dk/), Denmark, and [the University of Plymouth](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/), UK.
His research into [flexible deformable WECs](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2016.811), initiated while he was at Plymouth, was among the first of its kind. There is a continued interest in this idea, given the potential benefits of using flexible materials over rigid ones. At Aalborg, he participated in the WEC modelling task force of the International Energy Agency - Ocean Energy Systems. 

Since joining UWA, Adi has been involved in several research activities, including developments of [efficient methods for deterministic prediction of ocean waves](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apor.2021.102695), [multi-objective optimisation of arrays of WECs](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apor.2022.103225), [simplified modelling of parametric resonances in WECs](https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/rpg2.12229), modelling and optimisation of articulated WECs, [developments of methods to detect false rogue waves](https://doi.org/10.1175/JTECH-D-21-0108.1), and comparison of WECs, which has been his long-standing interest. He is currently supervising a number of Master's students on projects related to marine renewables. He is responsible for teaching parts of [_OCEN4007 Renewable Ocean Energy_](https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=OCEN4007).

Adi is the co-author of [_Ocean Waves and Oscillating Systems: Linear Interactions Including Wave-Energy Extraction (2nd edition)_](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108674812) with [Professor Johannes Falnes](https://folk.ntnu.no/falnes/index-e.html) (NTNU).
Since 2020, Adi has been a member of the Standards Australia Committee EL-066 on Marine energy - Wave, tidal and other water current converters.
