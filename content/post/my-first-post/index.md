I stumbled across Wowchemy recently and thought it would be nice to start my own website using it. I have so far been using [weebly](https://wavepowerlab.weebly.com), which is quite good and easy to use, but Wowchemy offers more possibilities which seem to suit my needs better. 

There is much to learn for me still, as it is not a WYSIWYG type of website builder, but I am excited with the ~~quirks~~ features it offers. 

I will continue to add more stuff whenever possible, so stay tuned!
