title: Modelling and optimisation of the M4 wave energy converter
summary: The M4 is a multi-float wave energy converter developed by Professor Peter Stansby from the University of Manchester. This project seeks to develop a numerical tool to optimise the design of the device. The tool couples a dynamic model of the device and a boundary element software.

The M4 is a multi-float wave energy converter developed by Professor Peter Stansby from the University of Manchester. In this project, our Master's student Nicholas McGrath is developing a numerical tool to optimise the design of the device. The tool couples a dynamic model of the device and a boundary element software. A generalised-mode approach is used to derive the equations of motion of the device.
This project is co-supervised by Dr. Hugh Wolgamot and Dr. Jana Orszaghova.
