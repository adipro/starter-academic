title: Modelling and optimisation of the M4 wave energy converter
summary: The M4 is a multi-float wave energy converter developed by Professor Peter Stansby from the University of Manchester. This project looks into developing a numerical tool to optimise the design of the device. The tool couples a dynamic model of the device, programmed in MATLAB, and a boundary element software.

The M4 is a wave energy converter composed of multiple floats connected by beams. It harnesses the power of the waves through relative rotation about a hinge.

In this project, our Master's student Nicholas McGrath develops a numerical tool to optimise the design of the device. The tool couples a mathematical model, which computes the response of the device including its power output, and a boundary element software, which computes the hydrodynamic forces on the device. We use a generalised-mode approach to derive the (linear) equations of motion of the device.
