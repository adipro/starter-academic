title: "Comparison of wave energy converters"
summary: "Although many fundamental results on wave power absorption were discovered in the 1970s and 80s, the most economic way of harnessing wave energy remains an open question. This ongoing project aims at developing new non-dimensional metrics to assess the relative cost-effectiveness of different wave energy converters."

Although many fundamental results on wave power absorption have been discovered a few decades ago, the most economic way of harnessing wave energy remains an open question. While there have been numerous separate studies on specific wave energy converters, comparative studies are rare, and little is known about how these devices measure against each other. This ongoing project aims at developing new non-dimensional metrics to assess the relative cost-effectiveness of different wave energy converters.
